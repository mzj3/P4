      <strong>Introduction</strong>
    </h2>
    <p data-inviewport="paragraph">This section of my site delves into the details of various projects I
      have either completed or am currently involved in. Projects, in general, have proven to be one of the most
      effective ways for me to learn, complementing my educational endeavors. They serve as an ongoing laboratory
      experience (without the guidance of a professor of course). Explore my Ubuntu section if you're intrigued by my
      experiences in managing a bare-metal server using custom scripts. The Stream Pi project allowed me to blur the
      lines between IT and Engineering, utilizing a microcomputer housed in a custom 3D-printed case. Lastly, this site
      serves as a compelling demonstration of my web development skills and the knowledge I've acquired along the way!

      alt="Ubuntu Server Interface">
    <br>
    <p data-inviewport="paragraph">&emsp;&emsp;My Ubuntu Server project began several years after I initiated the
      practice of
      running game servers on a free version of Windows 10. Lo and behold, Windows' desktop environment proved to be an
      impractical choice for hosting 24/7 services. It would frequently crash, freeze, and restart. At the time, I was
      also enrolled in my first SysAdmin course at NJIT, which gave me the basic knowledge of Linux distro CentOS 7.
      Acting on the advice of my professor at the time, I opted to use Ubuntu Server, a CLI-focused interface affiliated
      with Linux's most popular distribution. I felt confident in this decision, given its widespread popularity and
      robust support, ensuring a plethora of online resources and forums for troubleshooting.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p data-inviewport="paragraph">
      &emsp;&emsp;My server now acts primarily as a Nextcloud and OpenVPN server, with the occasional game server
      popping up
      depending on what my friends and I are feeling.
      The machine operates headlessly, utilizing SSH login and keys for remote administration. Cronjobs are employed to
      periodically restart and check for updates, maintaining the system's security. This project also gave me a lot of
      experience port forwarding, configuring Linux ufw firewalls, and setting up a domain name to allow for easy yet
      safe outside access.

    <br>
    <p data-inviewport="paragraph">&emsp;&emsp;The StreamPi project revolved around transforming a Raspberry Pi into an
      affordable
      streaming deck, a vital tool for web streamers managing live entertainment hotkeys. My aim was to create a
      budget-friendly alternative using StreamPi, an open-source Linux software, on a Raspberry Pi 4. Acquiring the
      necessary hardware involved purchasing a CanaKit for $100 and an ELECROW 5'' touchscreen for $62.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p data-inviewport="paragraph">&emsp;&emsp;
      The installation of Raspbian (Debian flavored distro for Raspberry Pi) and StreamPi, establishing a client-server
      connection, and
      adding functionality with professional-looking icons were relatively straightforward. Additionally, a 3D-printed
      case was crafted for the touchscreen, presenting challenges and lessons in the 3D printing process. Despite the
      difficulties, the project was a great way to overlap my IT skills with my MechE interests.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p data-inviewport="paragraph">
      &emsp;&emsp;While crafting a stream deck from scratch certainly posed its challenges, the satisfaction was worth
      it in the end. This project not only enhanced my day-to-day computer navigation, but also served as a sense of
      capability
      and inspiration for future in-depth endeavors. Special thanks to Professor Nazaro, one of my first IT professors,
      for giving me this opportunity and learning experience.

    <br>
    <p data-inviewport="paragraph">&emsp;&emsp;This website has offered me a way to finally explore my front end
      development desires. Through most of college, any classes I took involving web development were either backend
      focus. Up until now, most of my eggs were in the backend basket. I felt like I was missing out quite a bit on the
      HTML, CSS, and JS side of things. In my last semester I decided to take a class called IS 117, which focuses on
      the very basics of webdev, something that wasn’t exactly required for my IT Specialization.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p data-inviewport="paragraph">&emsp;&emsp;This site allowed me to explore the extensive capabilities of HTML and
      CSS. I finally got to understand what all the hype is around Bootstrap. However, I'm not a fan of Bootstrap’s
      stale look, so I decided to make / research my own look to make my website feel unique compared to what the class
      required. I also got re-acquainted with GitHub, learning about GitHub desktop and how easy it is to use compared
      to the CLI alternative.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p data-inviewport="paragraph">&emsp;&emsp;
      As someone who was not much of a fan of git, GitHub Desktop allowed me to stay organized
      with commits and push/pull requests as needed. This website is also fully hosted using GitHub pages, meaning that
      it’s truly available 24/7 without the worry of any anonymous traffic coming to my Ubuntu server by hosting it on
      there. I was also able to purchase and apply a domain name through namecheap, creating a very official look
      presentation. Afterall, it is the name of the website! Here is a link to my repository if you are interested. A very special thanks to Professor Chiusano for giving the opportunity to create this website and explore this side of my creativity!
